  # 2016-02-04T00:00:00Z
  $t->month += 1; $t->day += 3;

  # 2016-03-03T00:00:00Z
  $t->day += 28;

  # print all days of the week (2016-02-29T00:00:00Z to 2016-03-06T00:00:00Z)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Makes manipulating time structures more convenient. Internally uses L<Time::Moment>, and L<Time::Zone::Olson>.

Creates a Time::C object for the specified time, or the current time if no C<$year> is specified.

=over

=item C<$year>

This is the year. If not specified, C<new()> will call C<now_utc()>. The year is 1-based and starts with year 1 corresponding to 1 AD. Legal values are in the range 1-9999.

=item C<$month>

This is the month. If not specified it defaults to C<1>. The month is 1-based and starts with month 1 corresponding to January. Legal values are in the range 1-12.

=item C<$day>

This is the day of the month. If not specified it defaults to C<1>. The day is 1-based and starts with day 1 being the first day of the month. Legal values are in the range 1-31.

=item C<$hour>

This is the hour. If not specified it defaults to C<0>. The hour is 0-based and starts with hour 0 corresponding to midnight. Legal values are in the range 0-23.

=item C<$minute>

This is the minute. If not specified it defaults to C<0>. The minute is 0-based and starts with minute 0 being the first minute of the hour. Legal values are in the range 0-59.

=item C<$second>

This is the second. If not specified it defaults to C<0>. The second is 0-based and starts with second 0 being the first second of the minute. Legal values are in the range 0-59.

=item C<$tz>

This is the timezone specification such as C<Europe/Stockholm> or C<UTC>. If not specified it defaults to C<UTC>.

Creates a Time::C object for the specified arguments. All the arguments are optional, as long as there is at least one way to specify some kind of time with them.

If there is no date specified, it will default to today's date. If there is no timezone or offset specified, it will default to UTC. If there is a date, but no time specified, it will default to midnight.

=over

=item C<< epoch => $epoch >>

If the C<$epoch> is specified, it overrides all the other options but C<$tz> and C<$offset>, and this basically becomes a call to C<< Time::C->gmtime($epoch); >>, applying the C<$tz> or C<$offset> afterwards.

=item C<< second => $second >>

C<$second> sets the second of the day/hour/minute, depending on what other options were specified.

=item C<< minute => $minute >>

C<$minute> sets the minute of the day/hour, depending on what other options were specified.

=item C<< hour => $hour >>

C<$hour> sets the hour of the day.

=item C<< mday => $mday >>

C<$mday> sets the day of the month, if a C<$month> was specified.

=item C<< month => $month >>

C<$month> sets the month of the year. If no C<$mday> is specified, it will default to the C<1st> day of the month.

=item C<< wday => $wday >>

C<$wday> sets the day of the week, if a C<$week> was specified and no C<$month> was specified.

=item C<< week => $week >>

C<$week> sets the week of the year if no C<$month> was specified. If no C<$wday> was specified, it will default to the C<1st> day of the week, i.e. C<Monday>. 

=item C<< yday => $yday >>

C<$yday> sets the day of the year if neither C<$month> or C<$week> was specified.

=item C<< year => $year >>

C<$year> specifies the year, and if no C<$month>, C<$week>, or C<$yday> is specified, the day will default to C<January 1st>.

=item C<< tz => $tz >>

C<$tz> specifies the timezone, and will default to C<UTC> if neither C<$tz> or C<$offset> is given.

=item C<< offset => $offset >>

C<$offset> specifies the offset from C<UTC> in minutes, and will default to C<0> if neither C<$tz> nor C<$offset> are given.

This is the string that will be parsed by either L<Time::P/strptime> or L<Time::Moment/from_string>.

=head1 ACCESSORS

These accessors will work as C<LVALUE>s, meaning you can assign to them to change the time being represented.

Note that an assignment expression will return the I<computed> value rather than the assigned value. This means that in the expression C<< my $wday = $t->day_of_week = 8; >> the value assigned to C<$wday> will be C<1> because the value returned from the day_of_week assignment wraps around after 7, and in fact starts the subsequent week. Similarly in the expression C<< my $mday = $t->month(2)->day_of_month = 30; >> the value assigned to C<$mday> will be either C<1> or C<2> depending on if it's a leap year or not, and the month will have changed to C<3>.

Returns or sets the epoch, i.e. the number of seconds since C<1970-01-01T00:00:00Z>.

If the form C<< $t->epoch($new_epoch) >> is used, it likewise changes the epoch but returns the entire object.

Returns or sets the current offset in minutes. If the offset is set, it tries to find a generic C<Etc/GMT+X> or C<+XX:XX> timezone that matches the offset and updates the C<tz> to this. If it fails, it dies with an error.

  $t = $t->string($new_str, format => $format, strict => $strict);
  $t = $t->string($new_str, format => $format, locale => $locale, strict => $strict);

Renders the current time to a string using the optional strftime C<$format> and C<$locale>. If the C<$format> is not given it defaults to C<undef>. When setting this value, it tries to parse the string using L<Time::P/strptime> with the C<$format>, C<$locale>, and C<$strict> settings, or L<Time::Moment/from_string> if no C<$format> was given.

If the format specifies a timezone, it will be updated if it is valid. If not, it checks if the detected C<offset> matches the current C<tz>, and if so, the C<tz> is kept, otherwise it will get changed to a generic C<tz> in the form of C<Etc/GMT+X> or C<+XX:XX>.

If the form C<< $t->string($new_str) >> is used, it likewise updates the epoch and timezone but returns the entire object.

=item C<$new_str>

If specified, it will update the object by parsing the C<$new_str> with L<Time::P/strptime> if a C<$format> was passed, or L<Time::Moment/from_string> otherwise.

=item C<< format => $format >>

If specified, will be passed to L<Time::P/strptime> for parsing, or L<Time::F/strftime> for formatting.

=item C<< locale => $locale >>

If the C<$format> contains a locale-specific format specifier (see L<Time::P/Format Specifiers>), it will get the locale data for C<$locale>. Defaults to C<C>.

=item C<< strict => $strict >>

If C<strptime> is used for parsing, it will be given the specified C<$strict>. Defaults to C<1>.

  $t->second_of_day++;

  $t = $t->second_of_day($new_second);

Returns or sets the current second of the day, updating the epoch accordingly.

If the form C<< $t->second_of_day($new_second) >> is used, it likewise sets the current second but returns the entire object.

The second is 0-based where second 0 is the first second of the day. Legal values are in the range 0-86399.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 diff

  my $d = $t1->diff($t2);
  my $d = $t1->diff($epoch);

Creates a L<Time::D> object from C<$t1> and C<$t2> or C<$epoch>. It accepts either an arbitrary object that has an C<< ->epoch >> accessor returning an epoch, or a straight epoch.

=cut

method diff ($t: $t2) {
    my $epoch =
      ref $t2 ?
        $t2->can('epoch') ?
          $t2->epoch :
          croak "Object with no ->epoch method passed (". ref $t2 .")." :
        $t2;
    return Time::D->new($t->epoch, $epoch);
}

=head2 clone

  my $t2 = $t1->clone();

Returns a copy of C<$t1>.

=cut

method clone($t:) {
    my $c = ref $t;

    my $t2 = { %$t };
    bless $t2, $c;
}

=over

=item L<Time::D>

Like C<Time::C> but for durations.

=item L<Time::R>

If you need C<Time::C> times to recurr at regular intervals.

=item L<Time::F>

For formatting strings using an strftime format.

=item L<Time::P>

For parsing times from strings.

=item L<Time::Moment>

This implements most of the logic of this module.

=item L<Time::Zone::Olson>

Interfaces with the Olson timezone database.

=item L<Time::Piece>

A great time library, which is even in core perl.
