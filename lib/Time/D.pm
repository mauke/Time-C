=head1 DESCRIPTION

Allows you to differentiate between two times, manipulate the difference in various ways, and check what the computed comparison time is.

=cut

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new

  my $d = Time::D->new($base);
  my $d = Time::D->new($base, $comp);

Creates a Time::D object comparing the C<$base> epoch to the C<$comp> epoch.

=over

=item C<$base>

This is the epoch for the base of the comparison.

=item C<$comp>

This is the epoch for the time you want to compare to the base. If omitted, this defaults to the same as C<$base>.

=back

=cut

method new ($c: $base, $comp = $base) {
    bless { base => $base, comp => $comp }, $c;
}

method _setter ($d: $key, $new) {
    return sub {
        $d->{$key} = $_[0];
        return $d if defined $new;
        return $_[0];
    };
}

method _computed_setter ($d: $key, $new) {
    my %diff;
    @diff{qw/ sign year month week day hour minute second /} = $d->to_array();

    my $val = $diff{$key};

    my $ct = Time::C->gmtime($d->comp);
    return $val, sub {
        $ct->$key -= $val - $_[0];
        $d->comp = $ct->epoch;

        return $d if defined $new;
        return $_[0];
    };
}

=head1 ACCESSORS

These accessors will work as C<LVALUE>s, meaning you can assign to them to change the compared times.

=cut

=head2 base

  my $epoch = $d->base;
  $d->base = $epoch;
  $d->base += 3600;
  $d->base++;
  $d->base--;

  $d = $d->base($new_base);

Returns or sets the base epoch. This is the base time that C<< $d->comp >> gets compared against, and is the number of seconds since the system epoch, usually C<1970-01-01T00:00:00Z>.

If the form C<< $d->base($new_base) >> is used, it likewise changes the base epoch but returns the entire object.

=cut

method base ($d: $new_base = undef) :lvalue {
    my $setter = $d->_setter('base', $new_base);

    return $setter->($new_base) if defined $new_base;

  $d->sign = $sign;

  $d = $d->sign($new_sign);

Returns or sets the sign part of the difference - whether the difference between C<< $d->base >> and C<< $d->comp >> is positive or negative. Changing it changes C<< $d->comp >> to either be before the C<< $d->base >> or after it. The sign can be either C<+> or C<->.

If the form C<< $d->sign($new_sign) >> is used, it likewise changes the sign but returns the entire object.

  my ($sign, $years, $months, $weeks, $days, $hours, $minutes, $seconds) = $d->to_array();

Returns the difference between C<< $d->base >> and C<< $d->comp >> in the different units. This is like accessing them via the accessors, except you get everything in one single call. This method is what's used internally by the accessors to get their values.

This will be either C<+> or C<->, depending on if C<< $d->comp >> is ahead of or behind C<< $d->base >>.

=item C<$years>

This will be the difference in years.

=item C<$months>

This will be the difference in months after the years have been accounted for.

=item C<$weeks>

This will be the difference in weeks after the years and months have been accounted for.

=item C<$days>

This will be the difference in days after the weeks etc. have been accounted for.

=item C<$hours>

This will be the difference in hours after the days etc. have been accounted for.

=head2 to_string

  $d->to_string();
  $d->to_string($precision);
  "$d";

Returns the difference as a human readable string. The C<$precision> determines how precise the output will be, and it can range from C<0> to C<7> (though C<0> is pretty useless).

=over

=item C<$precision>

Determines how precise the output should be. The default is 7, which is the maximum precision and will tell you all the differences to the second. For precisions less than the maximum, the results are truncated. No rounding is done.

If you set it to C<0>, there actually won't be enough precision to see a difference at all, so you will get the string C<now> returned.

If you stringified the object, like C<"$d";> for example, the precision will be 2, and only the 2 most significant units of difference will be returned.

This is treated as a maximum, meaning that if the actual difference in the data is less than the given precision, it won't pad with arbitrary 0 units.

=back

The return value will be a string in one of the following forms:

=over

=item

C<now>

=item

C<in %s, [%s, ...], and %s>

=item

C<in %s>

=item

C<%s, [%s, ...], and %s ago>

=item

C<%s ago>

=back

Where the C<%s> will be strings such as:

=over

=item

C<1 year>

=item

C<%d years>

=item

C<1 month>

=item

C<%d months>

=back

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over

=item L<Time::C>

The companion to this module, which handles individual times.

=item L<Time::Seconds>

Which doesn't base itself on a specific epoch, so it's ostensibly simpler, but also less able to correctly get differences in months and days.

=item L<Time::Moment>

This is what this module uses internally to calculate the different units.

=item L<Number::Denominal>

Breaks up numbers into arbitrary denominations; deals excellently with durations as well, though it works in the same way as C<Time::Seconds>.

=item L<Time::Ago>

Like C<Time::Seconds> and C<Number::Denominal> it doesn't care about real dates when determining a timespan, and it specifically states that it is only an approximation.
